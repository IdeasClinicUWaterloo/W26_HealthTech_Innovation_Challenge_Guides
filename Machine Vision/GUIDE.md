# Machine Vision: Integrating an ML Model with OpenCV and MediaPipe
This guide will walk you through a machine learning (ML) model that is trained to identify exercises in combination with Google's Mediapipe and OpenCV. This ML model is an LSTM (long short-term memory) model, which can make predictions from sequences of data.
