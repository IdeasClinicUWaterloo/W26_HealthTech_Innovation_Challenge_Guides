# Scalable Systems for Personalized Care
At CCCARE, participants receive a personalized exercise plan (referred to as a "dosage") which specifies the amount and type of physical activity designed to meet their needs – this plan is constantly adjusted. Initial assessments carried out by Kinesiologists, rehabilitation or other health professionals determine the starting point for each participant based on their current physical ability, medical history, and personal goals.   

Patients’ exercise history and data must be consulted when adjusting exercise plans. Currently, CCCARE stores data using a mix of digital and paper-based systems: 
- exercise logs are stored on paper
- appointments are scheduled using AirTable
- intake assessments are written on paper and manually input into a Microsoft Access database by staff
- referrals from the Waterloo Regional Health Network (WRHN) are sent in by fax which requires manual entry into the database
  
Unfortunately, Access cannot be integrated with other clinical software or visualize data, hindering data sharing and coordination.

## The Challenge
Design a **scalable** system that makes it easier to prescribe, adjust, store, and share exercise doses efficiently.
