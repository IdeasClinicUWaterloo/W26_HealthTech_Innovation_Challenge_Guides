# Assisting Cognitively Impared Patients
CCCARE runs a Brain and Body program for individuals living with mild to moderate dementia or other cognitive impairments. This program is designed for patients who may have difficulty understanding, learning, and remembering how to do physical activities and movements.  There are special considerations to be made when working with individuals living with cognitive impairments. These can range from reducing distractions in the gym to the way CCCARE trains their student volunteers to communicate and demonstrate exercises. This impacts the exercise environment, how these participants are registered in CCCAREâ€™s systems (e.g. the front desk staff support registration and payment for this group), and how they interact with them on the floor. 

More information on considerations made can be found through [DICE modules](https://dementiawellness.com/dice/)

## The Challenge
Improve the delivery of effective care to cognitively impaired patients.
