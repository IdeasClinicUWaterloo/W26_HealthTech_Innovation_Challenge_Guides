# Remote Care
CCCARE wants to provide remote care for patients because the in-person programs have limited capacity, and they would like to encourage graduated patients to rely less on the facility. Some patients on the waitlist cannot physically attend due to medical constraints, leading to less than 10% of stroke and cancer patients from GRH receiving treatment at CCCARE. Moving towards remote treatment allows for the treatment of far more people at once without worrying about space or class size and provides graduates with support and community as they shift to more independent exercise. However, CCCARE is concerned with ensuring participants are getting safe and effective exercise.

## The Challenge 
Design a system that provides remote treatment for patients simultaneously and helps graduates transition to self-directed care. 

Here are some things to think about as you come up with solutions for this problem space: How can we combat that feeling of isolation and support them in maintaining their exercise habits? They’ve been used to working out with a group and an instructor, so how do we keep that sense of community going after they’re on their own?
