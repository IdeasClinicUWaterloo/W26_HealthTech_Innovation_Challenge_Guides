## Geriatric Exercise Case Study
Congratulations! You have recently joined the Centre for Community, Clinical & Applied Research Excellence (CCCARE) and have been tasked with streamlining some of their daily operations. CCCARE’s mission is to enhance the health of people in the community and support individuals as they manage illness or recover from injury. They run general exercise programs, as well as specialized sessions for people undergoing or recovering from cancer treatment, stroke survivors, and patients who have completed earlier programs but wish to continue using the facility.

Your team’s challenge is to develop ways for CCCARE to improve how they deliver care and scale their services. You’ve been selected for your strong problem-solving skills and your ability to innovate within an interdisciplinary team. CCCARE has identified three main focus areas for potential improvements:

- Expanding and managing the individualized exercise plans for each client
- Supporting remote, at-home care to reach more people and help graduates of the programs transition to self-managed exercise
- Tracking and assessing exercise activity to ensure quality and progress for all participants

You are encouraged to explore one of these focus areas in depth or develop your own innovative solution related to exercise for older adults. As long as your ideas are relevant to the overall challenges, you have creative freedom!

However, time is of the essence—CCCARE is hosting an upcoming event attended by potential investors who are eager to hear new ideas. If you'd like to present your concept, your team must develop a proof-of-concept prototype within the next two days for the pitch.
