# Welcome to the 2026 Health Tech Innovation Challenge!
## Geriatric Exercise Case Study
Congratulations! You recently joined the Centre for Community, Clinical & Applied Research Excellence (CCCARE) and are tasked with optimizing some of their day-to-day operations. CCCARE's mission is to improve the overall health of individuals in the community and help these indviduals manage illness and injury. They offer general exercise programs as well as more tailored ones for those being treated for or recovering from cancer, those experiencing effects from stroke, and any patients who have "graduated" from these programs but wish to continue using the facility.

Your team is tasked with coming up with ways CCCARE could improve their delivery of care so that they can scale their operations. You have been chosen for your ability to problem solve and innovate while working in an interdisciplinary team. Here are the three main areas which CCCARE has identified this problem space can be approached from:
- Scaling the storage and/or adjustment of exercise plans for each patient
- Remote at-home care in order to reach more patients and encourage graduated patients to move towards self-directed exercise
- Excercise tracking and measurement to monitor the quality of patients' activity

You have been given the freedom to dive deeper into one of these categories or to come up with a unique way to tackle the issues of geriatric exercise. As long as you stay relevant to the problem space, the sky is the limit!

But hurry! You must get started on your solution quickly since CCCARE is hosting an event where all the investors will be present. These investors are itching for new ideas, so if you want to pitch an idea your team must produce a proof-of-concept prototype in two days to pitch.
