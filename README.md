# Health Innovation Challenge:​ Exercise as a Healthcare Tool for Older Adults​
Congratulations! Your team recently joined the **Centre for Community, Clinical & Applied Research Excellence (CCCARE)** and has been tasked with streamlining some of their daily operations. CCCARE’s mission is to enhance the health of people in the community and support individuals as they manage illness or recover from injury. They run general exercise programs, as well as specialized sessions for people undergoing or recovering from cancer treatment, stroke survivors, and patients who have completed earlier programs but wish to continue using the facility.

## Your Mission

Your team at **CCCARE** has been tasked to develop ways for CCCARE to **improve how they deliver care and scale their services**. You’ve been selected for your strong problem-solving skills and your ability to innovate within an interdisciplinary team. CCCARE has identified three main focus areas for potential improvements:

- Expanding and managing the individualized exercise plans for each participant
- Supporting remote, at-home care to reach more people and help graduates of the programs transition to self-managed exercise
- Tracking and assessing exercise activity to ensure quality and progress for all participants

You are encouraged to explore one of these focus areas in depth or develop your own innovative solution related to exercise for older adults. As long as your ideas are relevant to the overall challenges, you have creative freedom!

However, time is of the essence as CCCARE is hosting an upcoming event attended by potential investors who are eager to hear new ideas. If you'd like to present your concept, your team must develop a proof-of-concept prototype within the next two days for the pitch.

## Sub-Problems

## Scale Personalized Care
At CCCARE, participants receive a personalized exercise plan (referred to as a “dosage”) which specifies the amount and type of physical activity designed to meet their needs – this plan is constantly adjusted. Initial assessments carried out by Kinesiologists, rehabilitation, or other health professionals determine the starting point for each participant based on their current physical ability, medical history, and personal goals.

Patients’ exercise history and data must be consulted when adjusting exercise plans. Currently, CCCARE stores data using a mix of digital and paper-based systems: exercise logs are stored on paper, appointments are scheduled using AirTable, intake assessments are written on paper and manually input into a Microsoft Access database by staff, and referrals from Waterloo Regional Health Network (WRHN) are sent in by fax, which requires manual entry into the database. Unfortunately, Access cannot be integrated with other clinical software or visualize data, hindering data sharing and coordination. 

### Challenge
Design a scalable system that makes it easier to prescribe, adjust, store, and share exercise doses efficiently.

## Exercise Tracking and Measurement  

In CCCARE, an instructor will work with 10-12 patients in a session. Meanwhile, sessions with graduated participants can have up to 30 people per instructor. Due to minimal supervision, there is no easy way to track each patient as they exercise. Therefore, some participants may not complete their full dose, while others might overdo it. Student volunteers are available to assist participants who may require extra support, such as patients with dementia and stroke patients. However, as not all participants will have a volunteer working with them one-on-one, there is a need to track the quality of exercises performed so that instructors are able to evaluate the participants’ progress. 

### Challenge

Design a system that tracks and measures the quality of patient activity. For more information and a step-by-step guide on how to implement various tools into your solution, check out the [Exercise Tracking and Measurement Folder](./Exercise_Tracking_and_Measurement).

## Remote (At Home) Care  

CCCARE wants to provide remote care for patients because the in-person programs have limited capacity, and they would like to encourage graduated patients to rely less on the facility. Some patients on the waitlist cannot physically attend due to medical constraints, meaning fewer than 10% of stroke and cancer patients from GRH receive treatment at CCCARE. Remote care would allow the treatment of far more people at once without worrying about space or class size, and provides graduates with support and community as they shift to more independent exercise. However, CCCARE is concerned with ensuring participants are getting safe and effective exercise. 

### Challenge

Design a system that ensures patients are completing the correct exercises and adhering to their treatment plans at home. For more information and a step-by-step guide on how to implement various tools into your solution, check out the [Remote (At Home) Care Folder](./Remote_(At_Home)_Care).
