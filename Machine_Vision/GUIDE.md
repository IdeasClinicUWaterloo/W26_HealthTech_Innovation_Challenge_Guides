# Machine Vision: Integrating Machine Learning with OpenCV and MediaPipe
## Table of Contents
1. Introduction

## 1. Introduction
This guide will walk you through a machine learning (ML) model that is trained to identify exercises in combination with Google's Mediapipe and OpenCV. This ML model is an LSTM (long short-term memory) model, which can make predictions from sequences of data. 

## 2. Installation
2.1 Download Python (versions 3.9 - 3.12)
* Currently, Mediapipe is only supported on python versions 3.9 to 3.12.
* You can download a compatible version of python [here] (https://www.python.org/downloads/).
